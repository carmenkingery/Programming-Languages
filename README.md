# Programming-Languages

This project was made to calculate how much a savings account would grow
with and without monthly deposits, given the starting principle, time span, 
interest rate, and monthly deposit. 
A couple things I could do to improve this program would be to get rid of the 
global variables I used, which would make the code more secure, and simplify 
the main function, which would enhance readability. However, I would 
say one thing I did particularly well would be the construction of functions
I used to declutter my main function. They are simple, to the point, and also 
take care of their own exeption handling. 
This code was not particularly difficult to write, but it is one of my prouder
pieces of work because I wrote the whole thing myself, without help from the instructor.
